title: Writing a intepreter from scratch
---
Curiosity is a amazing gift if you can freely explore the subjects pertinent to your interest.

This summer I wondered how actually do programming languages work. 
Luckily in college I learned a rough idea: code enter as string, gets chopped into tokens, 
tokens undergo syntax analysis then they are either fed to a VM or translated to machine code.

Fascinating, yet I felt that my knowledge is superficial. I couldn't implement a compiler 
tomorrow if I wanted. 

Therefore I asked help to books, specifically "Writing an interpreter in Go". 
Amazing piece that teaches you step by step how to build a compiler and in the 
meantime taught me a bunch about Golang it self.

By the last chapter I had a working functional programming language, my curiosity 
should've been satisfied. Unfortunately it wasn't the case. I was not impressed by 
my self, reading and typing some code from a book won't translate into actual knowledge on 
the subject, one has to get hands dirty.

I then embarked on a journey to expand the language by adding class support and OOP.
You can test the language at [this website](monkey.mrdima98.dev), see the code 
[here](https://github.com/MRdima98/interpreter) and read the breakdown on my [blog](blog.mrdima98.dev) or my [youtube video](asdf).
